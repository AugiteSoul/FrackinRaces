    "value" : "Avians are a race of colourful birdfolk whose tribal culture revolves around the worship of Kluex - the winged god of the Aether. They are natruals with staves and wands, and have a mean-streak when threatened that makes them quite dangerous. Their lithe bodies give them great jumping and thanks to (nearly useless) wings they are less at risk from a long fall.

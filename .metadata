  "description" : "*Disclaimer: Adding this mod to a character is a permanent choice, and will affect any characters created while it is installed.*\n\nUsed in tandem with FrackinUniverse, this mod adds species-specific powers to both vanilla and player-made races. \n\n*Should now function without FrackinUniverse, but you'll have useless immunities in some cases. It should still be playable*\n\n*Does not add races*\n\n\nRacial Abilities\n\n-----------------------\n\nEach race is quite different from vanilla, and each can be played however you choose...but many favor specific styles of play over others. Also please note that while I try to keep these lists up to date, the most accurate list of abilities will always be the* in-game character creation screen tooltips* for the various races.\n\n\nHUMAN: \n--------------------\nMax Health + 15%\nMax Energy +15%\n25% Knockback Resistance\nMax Food + 30 (total 100, from vanilla 70)\nJump Hold Time +0.02s\nPerfect Blocks increase Defense. Failing a block restores defense to normal.\nBoomerangs do +20% damage\n1h Melee Combos increase in damage per swing\n\n\n\nAVIAN:\n------------\nAvians are great if you like to jump high and cause a lot of pain. They are also quite mobile, as they have a reduced falling speed that keeps them safer from falls. They are also quite skilled with staves and wands and gain a significant bonus to attacks with them.\n\nAvian Rage: 8% base damage increase, with additional increases as you take more damage (maximum +33%). \nHP -15%\nEnergy +10%\nJump Speed increase\n65% reduction in Fall Damage\nSlightly slowed falling speed\n+20% staff and wand damage\n\n\nAPEX\n-----------------\nApex are swift and potent, but need to ingest a bit more food than other races. They like heavy weapons such as axes and hammers and do much more damage with them.\n\nHigh Metabolism: Increased food requirement, but gain +11% speed and +15% jump\nImmune to Jungle tiles\nImmune to Mud tiles\nMax HP +20%\n+20% Axe and Hammer damage\n\n\nFLORAN\n--------------\nFloran are unique to play as their bonuses revolve around sunlight and food. They are also exceptional hunters and gain bonuses with both bows and spears.\n\nPhotosynthesis: Regenerate your HP during sunlight hours no matter where you are\nFloran Hunger: As you get hungrier your damage increases. Near starvation, you have a substantial boost.\nHP -5%\nEnergy +15%\nReduced Breath Depletion rate. You won't drown as fast.\nSpear swings increase defense slightly. Holding the spear out acts as a defensive measure.\nAll bows do 20% more damage\n\n\nHYLOTL\n-----------------\nTrue warrior spirits, Hylotl are especially useful when wielding a shield , or underwater. They are skilled with larger weapons (2h sword powers coming soon) and gain a slight defense boost when swinging them.\n\nHylotl Genes: While submerged in liquid you gain +9 protection, +20 HP and are highly mobile underwater. While Hylotl cannot breathe underwater, they do gain an enormous set of lungs which grants them +1400s additional air capacity.\n\nStalwart Defense: When using a shield and successfully Perfect Blocking you regain HP. Each successive Perfect Block increases the regen rate. Failing a perfect block cancels the bonus.\n\nMax Health +20 \n“Wet” Status effect doesn’t affect them \nSwinging a Hammer or Axe (2h swords soon) increases defense\n\n\n\nGLITCH\n-------------------\nGlitch are clunky and tough, and their medieval way of life has them well prepared when using a shield. They are exceptional melee combatants and gain both defense and offense when fighting up-close and personal.\n\nGlitch Combat Training: When Perfect Blocking with a shield you gain a damage bonus. Each successive Perfect Block increases this bonus. Failing a block will reset the count.\n\nAttrition: Glitch need far less food than other races. However, this comes at a cost of an additional 15% Falling Damage. \n\nWhen immersed in water, lose some HP and Energy\n\nHP + 10%\nEnergy +5%\nProtection +7\nNeeds no air\nPoison Immunity\nBee Sting Immunity\nIncreased defense during melee combos\n\n\n\nNOVAKID\n-----------------\nNovakids are an interesting race, with some rather handy immunities. So long as their hungry star-like centres are kept well fed, they gain slight regeneration. They are natural marksmen, and gain a bonus with all firearms.\n\nHP -10%\nEnergy +40%\n60% Knockback Resistance\nGlow in the Dark\nSpeed +8.5%\nTOTAL Radiation Immunity \nBurn Immunity\n+8% damage with all firearms\n\n\nFELIN\n-------------------\n50% fall damage\nRun Speed +7%\nJump Height +15%\nDamage +8%\nInsanity Immunity\n\n\n\n\nORCANA\n----------------\nHP +40\nBreath protection\nImmune to wet effect\n\nUnderwater:\nSwim Boost 2\nMax Food increase\nRegeneration\n\n\nPEGLACI\n---------------:\nLiquid Nitrogen Immunity\nBasic Cold Immunity\n+20 Energy\nIce Slip Immunity\n\n\nAVALI:\n------------------\nFall slower and have slight gliding ability.\n+5% speed\n+5% jump\n+5% damage\nImmune to Snow\nImmune to Cold\n\n\nFENEROX\n---------------------\nHP -5%\nEnergy +10%\n+6% Damage\nNocturnal Regeneration\nMetabolism: Increased food consumption, but gain +11% speed and +15% jump\nImmunity to Poison\n\n\nAVIKAN:\n--------------------\nFire Immunity\nHeat Immunity\nHP + 20\n\n\nPONEX\n------------\n+25% ground speed\nImmune to Bees\nImmune to Honey\nKnockback Resistance 50%\n\n\nVIERA\n--------------\n+12% Speed\nImmunity to Slime\nReduced hunger rate\nreduced shield stamina regen time\nPerfect Blocking with a shield restores some energy. Successive blocks add to the amount healed. Failing a block resets the count.\n\n\nFAMILIAR\n--------------------\nGlow in the Dark\nBreath Amount x2\nBio-Ooze immunity\nSpiderweb immunity\nBlack Tar immunity\n\nINKLING\n----------------\ndecreased hunger rate\nImmune to Wet effect\n\nUnderwater: \nGreater decreased hunger\nbreath depletion rate reduction\nfaster Energy regen\nMax Energy +12\n\n\nMUNARI\n--------------\nNothing but a swim boost yet\n\n\n\nKEMONO\n---------------\nDecreased Shield Regen time\nPerfect Block limit regen reduced\nReduced food consumption rate\nSpeed +10%\nJump +10%\n\n\nKINEPTIC\n-------------------\nMax Energy +40\nEnergy Regen increase\nSpeed +5%\nJump +5%\n\n\nNEKO\n-------------\nHP + 20\nIncreased energy regen amount\n50% fall damage reduction\nSpeed +5%\nJump +10%\n\n\nVULPES\n--------------\nKnockback reduced 40%\nimmune to jungle tile slowdown\nEnergy +12%\nSpeed +14%\n\n\nVESPOIDS\n-------------------\n70% fall damage reduction\nsting immunity\nhoney immunity\n+8% speed\nSlighly sticky on walls (experiment)\nreduced air force\n\n\nQ: Do I need Frackin' Universe to use this mod?\nA: No, but most immunities of your race will be rendered pointless. But the rest is playable without issue.\n\nQ: I installed the mod but the races aren't showing up! What do?\nA: This mod does not add races, it simply makes each unique. Go to the race mod pages to get them\n\nQ: Why is [mechanic] not working?\nA:Likely because of a bug. let me know and I'll see what I can do. The more detail you can give me, the better.\n\nQ: Can you add [insert race name]? That's be sweet!\nA: Potentially! If you don't see it suggested in the comments already, mention it! It may take awhile, though.\n\nQ: I think this race should be [different mechanic] instead. Can you change it?\nA: Either yes or no. Thank you for the suggestions, but please accept a no if given.\n\nQ: Why are you so awesome?\nA: Well, because [redacted].\n\nQ: Why isn't this mod working?\nA: Question 1. If you have that, question 2. If that's not the issue, question 3.\n\n\n\nQ: Will this mod work with your existing character? \n\nA: Yes\n\nQ. Is your favorite race mod supported? \n\nA: Use your eyes and read. Do you see it listed? Yes? Then yes. No? Then no. \n\n\nQ: \"My races powers aren't working\" \n\nA:  You've probably installed something wrong or there is a conflict with another mod or something to this effect. All current abilities have been tested and are functioning perfectly well.\n\nQ:  Can you make a version without negative effects for races? (or) Can you make a version with different abilities. I don't like these!\n\nA: No. If you dislike the powers, don't use the mod. I'm not making multiple versions. Amazingly, I have a personal life.\n\n\n",

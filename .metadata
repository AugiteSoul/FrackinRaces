  "description" : "Apologies for having to re-upload this. The workshop refused to allow me to update the original. *Disclaimer: Adding this mod to a character is a permanent choice, and will affect any characters created while it is installed.*\n\nUsed in tandem with FrackinUniverse, this mod adds species-specific powers to both vanilla and player-made races.\n\n*does *NOT* add races. Only abilities for them. *\n\n\n\nRacial Abilities\n\n-----------------------\n\nAs an experiment, racial abilities have been added to FU. They are as follows:\n\n\n\nHUMAN: \n--------------------\nMax Health + 15%\nMax Energy +15%\n15% Knockback Resistance\nMax Food + 30 (total 100, from vanilla 70)\nJump Hold Time +0.02s\nPerfect Blocks increase Defense. Failing a block restores defense to normal.\nBoomerangs do +20% damage\n1h Melee Combos increase in damage per swing\n\n\n\nAVIAN:\n------------\nAvians are great if you like to jump high and cause a lot of pain. They are also quite mobile, as they have a reduced falling speed that keeps them safer from falls. They are quite skilled with staves and wands and gain a significant bonus to attacks with them.\n\nAvian Rage: 5.5% base damage increase, with additional increases as you take more damage. \nHP -15%\nEnergy +10%\nJump Speed increase\n65% reduction in Fall Damage\nSlightly slowed falling speed\n+20% staff and wand damage\n\n\nAPEX\n-----------------\nApex are swift and potent, but need to ingest a bit more food than other races. They like heavy weapons such as axes and hammers and do much more damage with them.\n\nHigh Metabolism: Increased food requirement, but gain +11% speed and +15% jump\nImmune to Jungle tiles\nImmune to Mud tiles\nMax HP +24%\n+20% Axe and Hammer damage\n\n\nFLORAN\n--------------\nFloran are unique to play as their bonuses revolve around sunlight and food. They are also exceptional hunters and gain bonuses with both bows and spears.\n\nPhotosynthesis: Regenerate your HP during sunlight hours no matter where you are\nFloran Hunger: As you get hungrier your damage increases. Near starvation, you have a substantial boost.\nHP -5%\nEnergy +15%\nSpear swings increase defense slightly. Holding the spear out acts as a defensive measure.\nAll bows do 20% more damage\n\n\nHYLOTL\n-----------------\nTrue warrior spirits, Hylotl are especially useful when wielding a shield , or underwater. They are skilled with larger weapons (2h sword powers coming soon) and gain a slight defense boost when swinging them.\n\nHylotl Genes: While submerged in liquid you gain +4 protection, +20 HP and are highly mobile underwater. While Hylotl cannot breathe underwater, they do gain an enormous set of lungs which grants them +1400s additional air capacity.\n\nStalwart Defense: When using a shield and successfully Perfect Blocking you regain HP. Each successive Perfect Block increases the regen rate. Failing a perfect block cancels the bonus.\n\nMax Health +20 \n“Wet” Status effect doesn’t affect them \nSwinging a Hammer or Axe (2h swords soon) increases defense\n\n\n\nGLITCH\n-------------------\nGlitch are clunky and tough, and their medieval way of life has them well prepared when using a shield. They are exceptional melee combatants and gain both defense and offense when fighting up-close and personal.\n\nGlitch Combat Training: When Perfect Blocking with a shield you gain a damage bonus. Each successive Perfect Block increases this bonus. Failing a block will reset the count.\n\nAttrition: Glitch need far less food than other races. However, this comes at a cost of an additional 10% Falling Damage. \n\nWhen immersed in water, lose some HP and Energy\n\nHP + 14%\nEnergy +5%\nProtection +3\nNeeds no air\nPoison Immunity\nBee Sting Immunity\nIncreased defense during melee combos\n\n\n\nNOVAKID\n-----------------\nNovakids are an interesting race, with some rather handy immunities. So long as their hungry star-like centres are kept well fed, they gain slight regeneration. They are natural marksmen, and gain a bonus with all firearms.\n\nHP -10%\nEnergy +40%\n25% Knockback Resistance\nGlow in the Dark\nSpeed +8.5%\nTOTAL Radiation Immunity \nBurn Immunity\n+8% damage with all firearms\n\n\nFELIN\n-------------------\n50% fall damage\nRun Speed +7%\nJump Height +15%\nDamage +8%\nInsanity Immunity\n\n\n\n\nORCANA\n----------------\nHP +25%\nEnergy -15%\n+2000 breath\n+70 breath regen rate\nImmune to wet effect\n+25% damage with spears\n\nUnderwater:\nSwim Boost 2\nMax Food increase\nMild Regeneration\n\n\nPEGLACI\n---------------:\nLiquid Nitrogen Immunity\nBasic Cold Immunity\n+20 Energy\nIce Slip Immunity\n\n\nAVALI:\n------------------\nFall slower and have slight gliding ability.\n+5% speed\n+5% jump\n+5% damage\nImmune to Snow\nImmune to Cold\n\n\nFENEROX\n---------------------\nHP -5%\nEnergy +10%\n+6% Damage\nNocturnal Regeneration\nMetabolism: Increased food consumption, but gain +11% speed and +15% jump\nImmunity to Poison\n\n\nAVIKAN:\n--------------------\nFire Immunity\nHeat Immunity\nHP + 20\n\n\nPONEX\n------------\n+25% ground speed\nImmune to Bees\nImmune to Honey\nKnockback Resistance 50%\n\n\nVIERA\n--------------\n+12% Speed\nImmunity to Slime\nReduced hunger rate\nreduced shield stamina regen time\nPerfect Blocking with a shield restores some energy.

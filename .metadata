  "description" : "*Disclaimer: Adding this mod to a character is a permanent choice, and will affect any characters created while it is installed. You can download NoFrackinRaces to uninstall. First remove this mod, immediately add that one and start up. After about 15 seconds the status effects *should* go away.*\n\nUsed in tandem with FrackinUniverse, this mod adds species-specific powers to both vanilla and player-made races. \n\n*Should now function without FrackinUniverse, but you'll have useless immunities in some cases. It should still be playable*\n\n*Does not add races*\n\n\nWill this mod work with your existing character? Yes it will.\n\n\n\nRacial Abilities\n\n-----------------------\n\nAs an experiment, racial abilities have been added to FU.
